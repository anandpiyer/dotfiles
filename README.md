## Karabiner-Elements
I use Karabiner-Elements for key remapping. Specifically, I remap my capslock key to both <kbd>Esc</kbd> (when pressed and released) and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> ( when held). Since this frees my ctrl key, I remap <kbd>ctrl</kbd> to be my <kbd>hyper</kbd> key (<kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>).

## Hammerspoon
Hammerspoon is used for both window management and app management.
